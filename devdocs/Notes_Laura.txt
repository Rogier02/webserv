🧩 1. Core architecture & configuration (Person A)

Focus: Foundation of the server and configuration parsing.

Tasks:

Parse and store the configuration file (server / location blocks, routes, methods, ports, etc.)

Implement the server startup logic:

Create and manage sockets

Bind to ports

Set up poll() or select() for multiple client handling

Handle basic error management and logging

Define core data structures (ServerConfig, Client, Request, Response, etc.)

Why:
This person defines the skeleton that the rest of the project runs on. They’ll set the stage for everyone else to plug their parts in.

🌐 2. HTTP protocol handling (Person B)

Focus: Request parsing, response building, and HTTP compliance.

Tasks:

Implement the HTTP request parser (headers, methods, body, chunked encoding, etc.)

Create the HTTP response builder (status lines, headers, content-length, etc.)

Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE)

Implement correct status codes and error handling (404, 405, 500, etc.)

Why:
This is the “heart” of the web server — turning raw socket input into meaningful HTTP requests, and output back into valid responses.

⚙️ 3. I/O handling, CGI, and testing (Person C)

Focus: Managing I/O, CGI scripts, and integration testing.

Tasks:

Handle the event loop and client connections (poll/epoll)

Implement CGI handling:

Environment setup

Forking and executing scripts

Managing input/output pipes

Serve static files (reading files from disk, directory listing if required)

Do integration tests with curl, browsers, and test configs

Why:
This person deals with the async and external aspects — ensuring the server actually runs well and communicates properly.

🔧 Integration phase (all three together)

Once the individual parts are working:

Integrate configuration → server startup → HTTP parsing → response handling.

Test extensively with multiple clients, edge cases, malformed requests, CGI scripts, etc.

Optimize (memory leaks, performance, file descriptors).

Refactor for readability and norm compliance.

💡 Tips for collaboration

Use Git branches per person (e.g., config, http, cgi).

Agree on core data structures early (Request, Response, ServerConfig).

Define clear interfaces between modules (so e.g. HTTP handler doesn’t need to know about socket details).

Have a weekly integration check — merge and test everything together to avoid huge merge conflicts at the end.
